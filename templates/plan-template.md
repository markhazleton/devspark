# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

<!--
  Design the smallest responsible change against the current implementation. Respect existing
  architecture, interfaces, compatibility, and governance. Ensure the resulting software remains
  understandable, testable, maintainable, and reasonably easy to change again. Avoid speculative
  abstractions and unnecessary extensibility.
-->

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/.devspark.work/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/devspark-plan` command. See `.devspark.work/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Rationale Summary

### Core Problem

[One concise sentence aligned with the Spec's Core Problem; do not copy its rationale or requirements.]

### Decision Summary

[Plan-owned decisions that resolve material implementation questions, with only the rationale needed to explain the choice. When a behavior could be integrated at an existing seam or distributed across call sites, record the chosen boundary and why. Point to `research.md` for evidence when it exists.]

### Key Drivers

- [Only a planning constraint or implementation driver not already stated in the Spec or technical context.]

### Reviewer Guidance

[One or two plan-specific assumptions or decisions to verify; omit generic guidance.]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Operating Context and Expected Mechanisms

<!--
  Just enough to reason proportionately (KISS / YAGNI). Not a capacity model.
  Expected counts are NOT limits: they set the expected shape of the change.
  If this plan introduces more than expected, explain why under "Deviations".
-->

```yaml
operating_context:
  expected_scale: "[small / bounded / ...]"
  expected_frequency: "[e.g., a few times a week, per request, nightly]"
  execution: operator-driven # operator-driven | automated
  human_review_acceptable: true
expected_new_mechanisms:
  states: 0
  runtime_settings: 0
  endpoints: 0
  persistent_stores: 0
  caches: 0
  background_workers: 0
```

**Deviations**: [Each mechanism beyond the expectation above, as its shape, the current requirement, invariant, or demonstrated constraint that forces it, and the least-complex constraint that still suffices. "None" is a good answer.]

## Expected Change Surface

<!--
  Orientation for Tasks, Analyze, Implement and owner lookup, not an allow-list. A legitimate
  supporting file outside it is explained, not rejected; new architecture or scope returns to Plan.
  Do not store counts (derive them) or a list of Knowledge nodes to update (owner lookup derives it).
-->

```yaml
expected_change_surface:
  - {path: "[file or bounded area]", change: "[add | modify | remove | inspect]", why: "[reason]"}
```

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]

## Context Resolution

*The bounded `.knowledge/` working set for this delta, pinned down here so `/devspark-implement` consumes it as already-resolved and never traverses more than one additional hop itself. `/devspark-analyze` validates every entry resolves against the current corpus; `/devspark-critic` judges whether the set is sufficient for the delta.*

This section records **resolved** context, which is a selection from — not a copy of — the
**candidate** context Context Projection returns. Projection is deliberately generous so that
nothing relevant is unreachable; this list is deliberately small. Record an item because the delta
needs it, not because the graph could reach it.

```yaml
context_resolved:
  - id: [knowledge id, e.g. token-service | azure-devops-work-tracking]
    kind: [knowledge | entity | entity-layer | decision]
    via: [relation or match that reached it, e.g. direct | depends-on -> auth-gateway]
    hop: [0|1|2]
    reason: [why this item informs the delta]
```

Flat Knowledge documents are first-class resolved context. A working set made entirely of
`kind: knowledge` entries is valid and complete — never promote a flat document into an entity
just so it can be listed here.

`hop: 0` is a direct lexical match, `hop: 1` is one authoritative relationship away, `hop: 2` is
two. Planning never records a hop greater than 2.

[Leave empty only if this delta touches no existing `.knowledge/` content — state that explicitly rather than omitting the section.]

## Project Structure

List only the directories or files this change adds, removes, or materially reorganizes. If the
layout is unchanged, state that and rely on `expected_change_surface`; do not copy a generic
repository tree into the plan.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified, or when repeated integration across call sites is chosen over an existing seam**

| Violation / Complexity | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
